# RFID-Based Drone Tracking System  

This project implements an **RFID-enabled drone tracking system** designed for **real-time identification, geofencing, flight path validation, and unauthorized drone detection**. The system integrates RFID technology with efficient data processing algorithms to enhance tracking reliability and ensure safe drone operations.  

## Features  
- **Real-time Identification** – Unique drone recognition using RFID tags.  
- **Geofencing** – Prevents drones from entering restricted or unauthorized areas.  
- **Flight Path Validation** – Verifies drone movements against predefined routes.  
- **Unauthorized Drone Detection** – Identifies and flags non-registered drones.  
- **Optimized Data Processing** – Improves reliability and reduces latency.  

## Applications  
- Secure airspace monitoring  
- Drone fleet management  
- Defense and surveillance systems  
- Commercial UAV regulation and compliance  

## Tech Stack  
- **RFID Modules** for drone identification  
- **Microcontroller / Embedded System** (e.g., Arduino / ESP32)  
- **Python / C++** for algorithm development  
- **Data Processing Algorithms** for validation and detection
